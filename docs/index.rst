WeasyPrint
----------

WeasyPrint offers a sophisticated solution that enables web developers to effortlessly convert HTML pages into stunning PDF documents, including detailed reports, invoices, and tickets.

Technically speaking, WeasyPrint serves as a visual rendering engine for HTML and CSS, optimized for exporting to PDF. It's committed to upholding web printing standards. Offered as open-source software, WeasyPrint is available under the BSD license.

While it incorporates multiple libraries, it doesn't rely on a comprehensive rendering engine such as WebKit or Gecko. Its CSS layout engine, crafted in Python, is specifically designed for pagination and is structured for easy modification.
